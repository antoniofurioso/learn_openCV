# Learn OpenCV

I make this repository to learn opencv. I follow the course from freeCodecamp.orgFollowing the course of freecodecamp.org I also wanted to create files containing the code of the video tutorials followed.

I want to point out that the algorithms of face detection and face recognition, are algorithms that do not perform 100%.

## Source dataset in face detection
Kaggle - 5 Celebrity Faces Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/dansbecker/5-celebrity-faces-dataset
